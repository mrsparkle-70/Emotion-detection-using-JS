## üöÄ PENDING WORK: To Be Done

1. Make a small input form which takes name age gender as input below the video tag.

2. Improving the UI using HTML CSS JS for a greater attractive LOOK.

3. Make sure to raise the issues and then make the contributions.

**Let's make it A GREAT UI**


##  üï∏ IMPORTANT: Bug Fixes

1. **`navigator.getUserMedia`**

`navigator.getUserMedia` is now deprecated and is replaced by `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`. To fix this bug replace all versions of `navigator.getUserMedia` with `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`.

2. **`Low-end Devices Bug`**

The video eventListener for `play` fires up too early on low-end machines, before the video is fully loaded, which causes errors to pop up from the Face API and terminates the script (tested on Debian [Firefox] and Windows [Chrome, Firefox]). Replaced by `playing` event, which fires up when the media has enough data to start playing.
